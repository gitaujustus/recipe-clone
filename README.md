## Concepts Used in the Code

### HTML Structure:
- The HTML structure defines the layout and content of the recipe page.
- Elements like `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<table>`, and `<td>` are used to organize content and present information.

### CSS Styling:
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is employed to enhance the visual presentation of the recipe page.
- Selectors such as `#hero-section`, `#recipe-title`, `#preparation-time`, `#div-titles`, `table`, and `td` are used to target specific HTML elements for styling.
- Properties like `width`, `height`, `background-image`, `padding`, `background`, `border-radius`, `font-size`, `color`, `border-bottom`, and `border-spacing` are applied to style various elements.
- Media queries (`@media`) are utilized to adjust styles based on screen size, ensuring responsiveness across devices.

### Responsive Design:
- The page layout is designed to adapt and display properly on devices with different screen sizes.
- Media queries are employed to adjust styling and layout based on the viewport width, ensuring optimal viewing experience across devices.
